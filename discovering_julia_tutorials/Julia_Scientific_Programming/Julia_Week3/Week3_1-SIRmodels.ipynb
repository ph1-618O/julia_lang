This law holds that all susceptibles have an equal chance of meeting an infected person. And the same is assumed for infected people. Then the number of  meetings of infecteds and susceptibles is proportional to product $SI$. We use the symbol $\\lambda$ for the constant of proportionality, and we interpret $\\lambda SI$ as the rate at which susceptibles become infected. This is of course a rate per day. So the actual loss over the time step $dt$ is actually $\\lambda SI\\,dt$ so the equation for $S$ is\n",

The gain of infecteds must be exactly the susceptibles who become infected, so the equation for $I$ is\n",
